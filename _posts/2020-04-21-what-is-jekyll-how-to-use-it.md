Growing sweet peas in a semi-arid climate with cold winters, short unpredictable springs, and hot summers can be tricky, but it's worth the extra effort to grow these beautiful fragrant flowers. 
	
# Growing Sweet Peas in Semi-Arid Climates

### Selecting Seeds
 [Select Seeds](https://www.selectseeds.com/collections/sweet-pea/){:target="_blank"} Offers a good selection of heirloom varieties and a few good newer Spencer types for a good price.
 [Uprising Organics](https://uprisingorganics.com/collections/sweet-pea){:target="_blank"} (which you can check by running gem -v)
 [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/){:target="_blank"} and [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/){:target="_blank"}

### After Installing the Requirements you can follow these guides:
**For detailed install instructions have a look at the guide for your operating system.**
* [macOS](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/){:target="_blank"}
* [Ubuntu](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/){:target="_blank"}
* [Other Linux Distros](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/other-linux/){:target="_blank"}
* [Windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/){:target="_blank"}

### Creating a new Jekyll site
**We can create a new Jekyll site just by a simple command:**<br>
> # `jekyll new my-site`

Jekyll will create a new directory named as `my-site` which is customizable (i.e., you can change the name from `my-site` to anything you want for example `jekyll new brutus`).

### Changing into the Directory
**We have to go inside the directory:**<br>
> # `cd my-site`

Again, `my-site` is just a random name which is customizable.

### Building the site and making it available on a local server
> # `bundle exec jekyll serve`

### Browsing your Jekyll site
> # Browse to [`http://localhost:4000/`](http://localhost:4000/){:target="_blank"}
